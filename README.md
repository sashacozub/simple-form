## Project goals ##
The goal for me here was to practice on validating user's input live while the user is filling in the form, so there is no need to submit the form to see what was filled in wrong and what potentially has to be fixed.

## App description ##
Very simple form with client-side JavaScript validation. Information box with the input rules is present where it is possible to check the minimum requirements for the form to be validated successfully. All of those rules are updated live with each key press. The form doesn't send any data anywhere, it is just a mock.
